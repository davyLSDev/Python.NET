# Python.NET

## About
This repo came about as a result of some experimentation with Python .NET, and few other libraries such as Qt, and wx. The second commit is simply a copy of the work that was already done but not committed to any particular repository.

## Getting set up

The dll library was created with the ff command:

```
csc /t:library MyMath.cs
```
